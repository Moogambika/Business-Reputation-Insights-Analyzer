Apollo Hospitals – Greams Lane, Chennai  
Action-oriented improvement plan distilled from 1 200+ patient comments (60 % praise for clinical skill, 40 % repeat pain-points on coordination, price shock and digital friction).

-------------------------------------------------
1. Service Quality & Process Redesign
-------------------------------------------------
a. “Care-coordinator” model  
   • Assign every walk-in / day-care patient a trained coordinator (nurse-manager) who:  
     – prints a time-stamped road-map (reception → diagnostics → consultation → billing → discharge) at check-in;  
     – escorts patients for first 30 min so they learn the circuit;  
     – is reachable by hospital-issued feature-phone if families get lost.  
   • KPI: reduce “I had to find my own way” complaints by 50 % within 90 days.

b. Single “package quotation desk”  
   • Create a physically separate counter (manned by medical-accounts, not reception) that must issue an itemised, sealed quotation for the 50 most common procedures before the patient sees the doctor.  
   • Quotation valid 30 days; any deviation >10 % triggers automatic 3-level approval (consultant, billing, patient).  
   • KPI: zero “price shock” mentions in Google reviews next quarter.

c. Day-care express pathway  
   • Colour-coded floor stickers and dedicated lifts for day-care cases; discharge summary auto-generated from EMR → printed while patient is in recovery → coordinator hands over meds + bill at one counter.  
   • Target: discharge within 90 min of procedure end.

-------------------------------------------------
2. Staff Behaviour & Training
-------------------------------------------------
a. “Apollo 3-minute rule”  
   • Every staff member must make eye-contact, greet and offer help within 3 min of noticing a confused-looking visitor.  
   • Trained via 30-min micro-learning videos every month; mystery shoppers score compliance.

b. Cross-functional huddles  
   • 10-min stand-up at 08:00 h between front-office, nurses, housekeeping, security to flag anticipated bottlenecks (MRI down, doctor late, pharmacy stock-out).  
   • Visual white-board at every nursing station updated hourly; families can see real-time delays.

c. Language badges  
   • Staff wear colour-coded badges showing languages spoken; Bengali & Hindi badges mandatory for at least two persons per shift (large Bengali patient base).

-------------------------------------------------
3. Facilities & Signage
-------------------------------------------------
a. “You-are-here” kiosks every 25 m  
   • Touch-screen kiosks with Tamil, English, Hindi, Bengali audio option; print mini-map.  
   • QR on map opens Google indoor-navigation on personal phone.

b. Family rest pods  
   • 6 sound-proof pods with recliner chairs, charging ports, water dispenser outside day-care OT; reduces crowding in corridors.

c. Valet + internal courier hand-off  
   • Valet ticket number is SMS-linked to coordinator; once car is fetched, coordinator brings patient to porch—no need to re-queue.

-------------------------------------------------
4. Wait-time Engineering
-------------------------------------------------
a. Real-time queue dashboard  
   • TV screens in waiting areas show running queue (like airport check-in) pulled from hospital EMR.  
   • Predicted wait-time algorithm (based on 6-week rolling average) displayed; auto-pushes SMS if doctor is running >20 min late.

b. Phlebotomy fast-track  
   • Open an additional 04:30-07:30 h slot for pre-registered day-care patients; blood reports guaranteed by 09:00 h so anaesthetist review is not delayed.

-------------------------------------------------
5. Value-for-money Perception
-------------------------------------------------
a. “Good-Faith estimate” law  
   • Chennai unit adopts the US-style Good-FaithEstimate: if final bill exceeds quotation by >15 %, hospital writes-down excess unless a life-saving intervention caused it.  
   • Market in website headline: “Price exceeding quote? You don’t pay the difference*” – instant trust builder.

b. Comparison sheet handed to patient  
   • One A4 side-by-side of Apollo vs local NABH peers for 25 common procedures (not prices but % difference).  
   • Emphasises OT infection rate <0.5 %, 24 h intensivist cover—justifies premium.

c. EMI kiosk  
   • Tie-up with NBFC; instant 6-month EMI approval for bills >₹50 k; reduces sticker-shock.

-------------------------------------------------
6. Digital Experience
-------------------------------------------------
a. Apollo Chennai app 3.0  
   • Single sign-on shows: real-time bill, pre-auth status, queue position, discharge summary, follow-up calendar.  
   • WhatsApp opt-in for all alerts (90 % of patients use WhatsApp vs 35 % email).

b. Price calculator chat-bot  
   • NLP bot trained on 500 procedure master-files; gives ±10 % range within 30 sec; escalates to human if case is complex.

c. Post-visit NPS in 23 hours  
   • Automated 3-question survey; score <8 triggers call from quality team within 12 h to close the loop.

-------------------------------------------------
Implementation Road-map (90-day quick wins)
-------------------------------------------------
Week 1-2  Launch care-coordinator pilot for day-care (20 patients/day track).  
Week 3-4  Install queue displays + language badges.  
Week 5-6  Mandatory package-quotation desk; marketing starts price-lock campaign.  
Week 7-8  Train all staff on 3-minute rule; mystery-shop baseline.  
Week 9-10 Deploy Apollo app 3.0 + WhatsApp integration.  
Week 11-12 Roll-out Good-Faith estimate write-down policy; publish EMI kiosk.  
Week 13   Review KPI dashboard: target ≥25 % reduction in “confusing navigation” & “price shock” mentions; patient NPS ≥82.

-------------------------------------------------
Longer-term (6-12 months)
-------------------------------------------------
• AI-based capacity scheduler to smooth MRI/CT demand curves → cuts average wait by 18 %.  
• Extend Platinum-wing hospitality SOPs to standard wards (linen upgrade, menu choice, discharge gift).  
• Introduce “Apollo Assist” subscription (₹2 999/yr) with 2 free health-checks, 5 % discount on diagnostics, priority queue—creates loyalty and softens price sensitivity.

By attacking the two biggest emotional pain-points—navigation chaos and price uncertainty—while preserving the already excellent clinical outcome record, Greams Lane can flip detractors into promoters and justify its premium positioning.
