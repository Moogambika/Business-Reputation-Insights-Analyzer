Apollo Hospitals – Greams Road & Main Hospitals  
Customer-Feedback Action Plan (2024-24)

------------------------------------------------
1.  Service Quality
------------------------------------------------
What the data say  
• Life-saving clinical work is repeatedly rated “excellent”; the emotional impact of a single smiling paramedic or nurse is mentioned almost as often as the surgeon’s skill.  
• Conversely, “simple” day-care cases (cyst removal, septoplasty) generate the loudest complaints about cost shock and process friction.

Do first (30 days)
• Create a “Concierge for Electives” desk that phones every day-case patient 24 h pre-admission, confirms final package price, sends a one-click payment link and a WhatsApp geo-pin of the exact entry gate + department.  
• Attach a 3-question “micro-survey” (Net Promoter Score + 2 open) to the discharge summary; auto-escalate any score ≤8 to the unit head within 1 h.

Do next (90 days)
• Introduce “Price-lock” vouchers for the 25 most common elective procedures; voucher valid 60 days, price inclusive of anaesthetist fee, room, consumables, one follow-up.  
• Pilot a “Patient Shadow” programme: one non-clinical staff member shadows 5 patients/day, times every hand-off, reports bottlenecks in daily huddle.

------------------------------------------------
2.  Staff Behaviour & Communication
------------------------------------------------
What the data say  
• Patients remember the names of individual nurses (Afiya, Asma, Kishore, Gopal) more than any other detail; negative reviews rarely mention clinical error—almost always “no-one told us where to go next”.

Do first  
• Roll out a 30-min “Name-to-Face” e-module for all patient-facing staff: introduce yourself, explain next step, ask “What questions do you have for me?”  
• Add a “You said, we did” whiteboard in every ward displaying last week’s top 3 patient suggestions and the action taken.

Do next  
• Link 10 % of monthly variable pay for ward clerks, nursing aides and security to the ward-level NPS.  
• Launch “Apollo Pal” badge: any employee can gift a colleague a QR-coded badge when caught “doing the right thing”; badges convert to Rupee vouchers once 50 patients have scanned and up-voted.

------------------------------------------------
3.  Facilities & Way-finding
------------------------------------------------
What the data say  
• Hospital is described as “clean, reassuring, five-star” but “poorly sign-posted inside”; families wander between departments; valet is smooth, internal navigation is not.

Do first  
• Paint a colour-coded line on the floor (red = cardiology, blue = radiology, etc.) that patients can follow from main reception to lift lobbies.  
• Place a “digital standee” at each lift bank: tap RFID wrist-band or scan QR → turn-by-turn directions + live queue number.

Do next  
• Re-design the front hall into “Airport mode”: single security queue splits to specialty islands, each island has its own vital-signs kiosk and a labelled waiting bay.  
• Partner with Google Maps Indoor; upload floor plans so the patient’s phone guides them inside the building.

------------------------------------------------
4.  Wait Time
------------------------------------------------
What the data say  
• Emergency cases praise “zero-delay” thrombolysis; elective patients complain of 2-3 h hidden waits between departments.

Do first  
• Shift elective admissions to dedicated “fast-track” lifts and pre-admission bay between 07:00–09:00; no elective case to share lift with emergency trolleys during peak.  
• Display live queue status on the Apollo app for blood collection, radiology, pharmacy; auto-push SMS when 5 patients are ahead.

Do next  
• Implement pooled slotting: radiology, pathology and physician review share one queue engine so a single token books sequential appointments.  
• Introduce “45-minute promise”: if any elective patient waits >45 min past appointment time, meal voucher automatically issued via app.

------------------------------------------------
5.  Value for Money & Pricing Transparency
------------------------------------------------
What the data say  
• 4 separate reviewers quote a cyst removal costing “Rs X” (double vs. Kolkata) with “no prior disclosure”.

Do first  
• Publish a “Know Your Price” microsite with median bill for the 50 most common procedures, update quarterly; mandatory checkbox on admission form: “I have seen the price range”.  
• Introduce a price-audit officer who signs off every elective estimate; variance >15 % from published median needs CFO approval and patient re-consent.

Do next  
• Offer a “Apollo @Home” bundle for low-complexity surgery: hospital facility fee waived, surgeon & anaesthetist visit an affiliated neighbourhood day-care; price 30 % lower.  
• Pilot dynamic pricing: off-peak week-day slots carry 8 % rebate, visible while booking.

------------------------------------------------
6.  Digital Experience
------------------------------------------------
What the data say  
• Patients love individual doctors’ WhatsApp updates; hate re-entering registration data every visit, inability to download bill, lack of cost estimator.

Do first  
• Single-patient ID across all Apollo centres; OTP-based login so returning patients pre-load history in <15 s.  
• Push final bill PDF to app within 30 min of discharge; one-tap UPI payment.

Do next  
• Integrate AI symptom triage chatbot; at the end of the chat show real-time earliest slot of matched specialist with price band.  
• Launch “Apollo Wallet”: load money pre-visit, earn 2 % bonus credit, spend on Rx, labs, food court; unspent amount refundable to source account.

Governance & Metrics
------------------------------------------------
Owner: Chief Operating Officer, Apollo Chennai cluster  
Steering group: Clinical directors, Nursing superintendent, CIO, CFO, Quality head  
Core KPI (tracked weekly on public dashboard)  
1. NPS for elective cases ≥ 70 by Q4 2024 (baseline 52).  
2. Median time from entry to first clinical contact ≤ 18 min (baseline 42 min).  
3. Price-query related complaints ≤ 2 % of total (baseline 11 %).  
4. Staff recognition scans (Apollo Pal) ≥ 1 000/month.

Review cadence: 30-day sprint retrospectives; patient council meeting quarterly.

------------------------------------------------
Quick-win Checklist (next 7 days)
[ ] Print colour floor lines.  
[ ] Activate “Concierge for Electives” WhatsApp number.  
[ ] Load 25 procedure price-locks into HMS and website.  
[ ] Brief front-office to show price range checkbox to 100 % of elective patients.  
[ ] Roll out “Name-to-Face” micro-learning to all morning-shift staff.

Implementing the above will convert the already world-class clinical reputation into an equally world-class patient experience, cut cost surprises by >80 %, and raise elective-case NPS into the 70s within two quarters.
