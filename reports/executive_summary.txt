3. Recurring Themes  

Positive Drivers  
• Hero Doctors: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT), Dr. M. Rehan Sayeed (CTVS), Dr. Kartik Natarajan (GI), Dr. Raghunath K J (Surgery) and several ICU specialists are called out for “masterful skill + calming presence”.  
• Nursing & Allied Staff: described as “attentive, gentle, prompt—remembered our names”.  
• Infrastructure: clean, well-signposted, modern equipment; Platinum Wing likened to a “five-star stay-cation”.  
• Speed in Emergencies: door-to-balloon times for MI, rapid response to Code Blue situations.  
• Seamless Diagnostics: pre-op clearances, labs and pharmacy turn-around times praised.

Pain Points  
• Internal Navigation & Coordination: patients moved “from pillar to post”; no single care-coordinator; long waits between departments.  
• Pricing Transparency: several cases of 2-3× expected cost for day-care / cyst / basic endoscopy; quotes given exclude consumables, room-category uplift, consultant fees.  
• Billing Desk Attitude: “take it or leave it” feel; itemised statements only on insistence.

• Price-band calculator for common day-care procedures; publish 80-percentile package rate on website.  
• Centralised queue-management (already piloted in cardiology) to be rolled out hospital-wide.  
• Create a “price-match” desk for routine surgeries—offer to meet reputable competitor quote; converts detractors into promoters.  
• Continue investing in nursing excellence—this is the hospital’s clearest differentiator.

Bottom line: Apollo Chennai is clinically trusted and emotionally valued; it risks brand erosion unless it fixes billing transparency and intra-hospital coordination.
