Based on the customer feedback trends, the following practical business improvement recommendations are generated, focusing on service quality, staff behavior, facilities, wait time, value for money, and digital experience:

**Service Quality**

1. **Improve staff training**: Some reviews mentioned that the staff were friendly and attentive, while others experienced a lackadaisical attitude. Provide regular training to staff on customer service expectations, especially during peak hours.
2. **Enhance customer experience during peak hours**: Consider implementing a queue management system or providing additional staff during peak hours to minimize wait times and ensure that customers receive their orders promptly.

**Staff Behavior**

1. **Reinforce customer-centric behavior**: Some staff members were reported to be rude or unhelpful. Emphasize the importance of treating customers with respect and kindness, and provide feedback mechanisms to ensure staff are held accountable.

**Facilities**

1. **Maintain cleanliness**: Some reviews mentioned that the washroom was not clean. Ensure that the facilities, including washrooms, are regularly cleaned and well-maintained.
2. **Provide adequate amenities**: Consider restocking tissues and other essential amenities in the washrooms to meet customer needs.

**Wait Time**

1. **Optimize staffing during peak hours**: Analyze peak hour traffic and adjust staffing levels accordingly to minimize wait times.
2. **Streamline order-taking processes**: Implement efficient order-taking processes, such as mobile ordering or digital menu boards, to reduce wait times.

**Value for Money**

1. **No specific recommendations**: Customers generally appreciate the quality of the coffee and food, indicating that they feel they receive value for their money.

**Digital Experience**

1. **Leverage digital channels for customer engagement**: Engage with customers on social media, respond to online reviews, and consider implementing a loyalty program or digital rewards scheme to enhance the customer experience.

**Additional Recommendations**

1. **Consider parking options**: While not directly related to the in-store experience, providing information on nearby parking options or offering valet parking could enhance the overall customer experience.
