Taj Mahal Palace – Actionable Improvement Plan  
(derived from 100 % 5-star feedback; focus = “what could still go wrong tomorrow”)

1. Service Quality – keep the magic, kill the micro-friction  
   a. “Invisible” standards: codify 30-second visual sweep of every public area; litter / used glass disappears before guest eyes register it.  
   b. Pre-emptive recovery: give every manager a monthly budget of “instant yes” comps ( ₹ 2 000 each) to fix issues before guest reaches room / table.  
   c. Signature ritual fatigue: rotate welcome drink / garland every quarter so repeat guests still feel the “first-time” surprise.

2. Staff Behaviour – from “warm” to “effortlessly personal”  
   a. AI-assisted memory: CRM to flag micro-preferences (e.g., Mrs. Shah likes room at 21 °C, extra firm pillow) so staff can greet with “We have already set your preferred temperature.”  
   b. Language sprints: 10-minute daily micro-classes (Bell-boys: basic Korean; F&B: toddler-friendly phrases) – keeps TripAdvisor keywords like “helped with my month-old nephew” coming.  
   c. Empowerment cap: raise on-spot spend authority for front-line from ₹ 2 000 to ₹ 5 000 without supervisor sign-off – removes the last “I’ll have to check with my manager” moment.

3. Facilities – heritage with zero age spots  
   a. Stone & teak audit: quarterly tactile night-walk with white gloves to catch early chips / splinters before Instagram does.  
   b. Heritage whisper stations: discreet QR bronze plaques that open 30-second audio story; reduces crowding at concierge desk and deepens “living museum” feel.  
   c. Mother & baby micro-lounge: 2-chair feeding nook in Palace wing corridor – keeps review line “even dining with a baby was stress-free” evergreen.

4. Wait-Time – luxury has no queue  
   a. Virtual queue for Shamiana: guest scans table code, orders drink while waiting in Sea Lounge; push notification when table ready → perceived wait = 0.  
   b. 18-minute room-service SLA; kitchen display timer turns red at 15 min, chef must call guest with free dessert offer – prevents “slow” ever appearing in print.  
   c. Elevator intelligence: disable call-button when carriage >80 % load during 08:30-09:30 and 19:00-20:00; automatically dispatches second lift to that floor.

5. Value-for-Money – justify the tariff daily  
   a. “Tajness” calculator: folio foot-note shows rack vs. paid rate + value of inclusions (airport transfer ₹ 2 800, breakfast ₹ 2 200, Wi-Fi ₹ 999) – psychological proof of deal even for luxury guests.  
   b. Hyper-local experience credit: ₹ 1 500 that can only be spent on Indian masterclasses (Paan-making, Kolam art) – keeps spend on-property while reinforcing cultural narrative.  
   c. 24-hr flexible cancellation for direct bookings; removes last-minute OTA under-cutting.

6. Digital Experience – flawless, but invisible  
   a. One-tap WhatsApp check-in: passport photo + digital signature; average lobby time <90 seconds.  
   b. Augmented-reality Instagram filter that overlays 1903 photo over present-day façade; encourages UGC, keeps hotel top-of-feed without ad spend.  
   c. Bandwidth SLA: 50 Mbps per device, monitored every 30 min; auto-ticket to ISP if <40 Mbps for 10 min – because “Wi-Fi was patchy” is the only blemish that appears even in palace-class hotels.
