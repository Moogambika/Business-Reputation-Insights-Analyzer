-------------------------------------------------
Action Plan (next 12 months)
-------------------------------------------------
Service quality  
- Micro-skill refresh every 6 months for F&B teams on “silent service” & table-staggering to cut 10 % service time during 12:30-14:00 rush.  
- Introduce “30-second rule”: manager presence at any table that waits >90 seconds for water or order acknowledgement.  
- Pilot AI-based rostering (LabourOptix or similar) to predict check-outs & align luggage-assist staff; target 0 guest-assisted luggage movements.

Staff behaviour  
- Add 20 hours of sign-language & basic Spanish/Mandarin e-learning; reward completion with digital badge displayed on name tag – guests instantly know whom to approach.  
- “Tajness story” flash-cards for all contract security (they currently score lowest on TripAdvisor sub-ratings).  
- Empower butlers to authorise INR 5 000 on-the-spot recovery without supervisor sign-off – reduces guest effort metric (GES) by 1 point.

Facilities  
- Soft-refurb Tower-wing bathrooms (rain-shower + back-lit mirrors) without touching façade; capex INR 18 Cr, pay-back 4.3 years via 4 % ADR uplift.  
- Convert one heritage store-room into “Instagram gallery” with rotating Ratan Tata memorabilia – drives 5 % more UGC, estimated 50 Mn free impressions/yr.  
- Replace single-use 30 ml bathroom amenities with 300 ml wall-mounted artisanal dispensers; saves 1.2 Ton plastic/yr and aligns with luxury eco-lux trend.

Wait time  
- QR wait-list at Sea Lounge; SMS when table is 10 min away – cut physical queue by 40 %.  
- Pre-fixe “Taj Express” 45-minute business lunch menu (starter-main-coffee) served within 30 min; priced 20 % below à-la-carte average – captures local office crowd, raises seat turns from 1.8 to 2.4 at lunch.

Value for money  
- Bundle “Taj Moments” credit into rate: INR 2 000/room-night usable at spa, bar or souvenir shop; perceived value 3-4× cost, lifts RevPAR by 2.1 %.  
- Stay 3-pay-2 for Mon-Thu in low-demand weeks (historically 68 % occ.) – adds 6 points occupancy with minimal rate dilution.

Digital experience  
- One-tap check-in via app + digital key to 150 rooms (Tower pilot) – cuts front-desk queue 30 %.  
- WhatsApp 2-way integration (already live at Taj Fort Aguada) rolled out property-wide; auto-translate 40 languages, SLA 3 min.  
- Add “Taj Wallet” – house-account that lets guests post F&B/spa bills to room without signing chits; shortens departure time by 2.5 min on average.

KPI targets 2025 vs 2023 baseline  
- Guest Satisfaction Score: 92 → 95  
- F&B average seating time lunch: 55 → 42 min  
- Tower wing ADR premium vs competition: +7 % → +15 %
