Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai – Customer-Feedback Action Plan  
(What guests are raving about + where even excellence can be stretched further)

1. Service Quality  
What guests love: “staff exceptionally polite, attentive, professional … went out of the way to help with our month-old baby.”  
Keep-the-magic actions  
- Micro-skill refresh every 90 days (eye-contact within 5 m, anticipate not react, name-use twice during a course).  
- Baby & family “quiet kit” standard in every F&B outlet (steriliser, puree warmer, plush toy, emergency nappy) – turns helpful staff into heroic staff.  
- “Silent service” protocol for business/couple tables (serve from left, clear from right, no conversation unless initiated).  
- Post-meal 30-second manager survey via 2-question WhatsApp form → nightly dashboard gives next-day coaching material.

2. Staff Behaviour  
What guests love: warmth, grace, “every corner radiates hospitality”.  
Stretch actions  
- Empower every associate to spend up to ₹2 000 per incident to recover a service miss without supervisor approval (keeps the “Tajness” tone even when things go wrong).  
- Rotate “you-first” days: once a month staff swap roles (doorman becomes luggage porter, waiter becomes housekeeper) – builds empathy and cross-skills.  
- Add sign-language & basic Korean / Mandarin e-cards on staff phones; international guests feel “seen” without lengthy explanations.

3. Facilities  
What guests love: palace architecture, sea view, cleanliness, security.  
Fine-tune actions  
- Premium restrooms mini-refit every 18 months (sensor taps, Dyson combo units, subtle oudh scent) – guests benchmark luxury by loos.  
- Replace corridor carpet with high-density, pattern-rich, bleach-cleanable axminster – looks regal but removes the “old-hotel” smell trap.  
- Create 3 “Instagram walls” with professional lighting; guests queue to shoot, free marketing for Taj.  
- One “quiet floor” per wing: key-card activated sound dampeners, 10 pm–8 am soft-close doors guarantee – business travellers willingly pay 8 % higher BAR rate.

4. Wait Time  
Current pain-point not mentioned in praise – prevention before it appears.  
Actions  
- QR pre-order while waiting to be seated; first course fires when guest sits, perceived wait drops 7 min.  
- Dynamic seating app: if Shamiana is full, algorithm offers instant table at nearby Aquarius with 20 % food credit; guest stays on-property, revenue retained.  
- Breakfast “10-minute promise”: any plated egg/dukkla/pancake order served within 10 min or it’s free (kitchen pacing tool already used by J.W. Marriott Gurgaon).

5. Value for Money  
What guests say: “expensive … completely worth”.  
Safeguard the perception  
- Introduce “Taj Epicure Local” – ₹ 18 k yearly dining only (vs 24 k full membership) – hooks young affluent Mumbaikars who will post the most.  
- Lunch “Thali-of-the-day” at ₹ 2 200 (all-in) in Shamiana; limited portion but same ingredients as à-la-carte → price anchor makes main menu look reasonable.  
- Transparent sustainability surcharge (₹ 50 pp) replaces hidden cost; 70 % of surveyed luxury guests accept it when they know it funds local fishermen & bio-gas.

6. Digital Experience  
Current state: praise is analogue; digital layer is invisible.  
Close the gap  
- Property-wide IoT: when returning guest’s phone re-joins hotel Wi-Fi, room lights greet with favourite colour (saved from last stay).  
- In-app AR walking tour of palace history; unlocks food credit when completed → educates while driving F&B upsell.  
- One-click “Book your exact table” with sea view map; upsell ₹ 500 for window-adjacent spots (already proven at The Oberoi Delhi).  
- WhatsApp “Taj Buddy” 24 h chatbot in 6 languages; escalation to human within 2 min – cuts call-centre load 35 % at The Peninsula HK.

Quick-win calendar  
Next 30 days – roll out baby kits, QR pre-order, 10-min breakfast promise.  
Next 90 days – empower spend policy, AR history tour, AR history tour, carpet replacement pilot floor.  
Next 12 months – sign-language cards, IoT lighting, dynamic seating algorithm, Thali anchor pricing.

Measure relentlessly  
Target: +8 pts in TripAdvisor “value” rating, –3 min average breakfast wait, +12 % non-staying F&B revenue, 50 k new Instagram tags/year.  
Review quarterly in “Tajness Council” with frontline captains, finance, marketing – keeps the palace ahead of copy-cats and ever-rising guest expectations.
