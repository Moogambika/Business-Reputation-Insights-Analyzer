**Service Quality**

1. **Improve staff attentiveness**: Ensure that staff greet customers promptly and attend to their needs in a timely manner. The lackadaisical attitude experienced by some customers can be addressed through staff training and incentives.
2. **Enhance order accuracy**: Implement processes to minimize errors when preparing orders, such as double-checking orders before handing them over to customers.

**Staff Behavior**

1. **Train staff on customer service**: Provide ongoing training to staff on customer service skills, including how to handle customer complaints and queries in a friendly and professional manner.
2. **Foster a positive staff attitude**: Encourage a positive and welcoming attitude among staff, recognizing that this can significantly impact the customer experience.

**Facilities**

1. **Maintain cleanliness**: Ensure that facilities, including washrooms, are clean and well-maintained at all times. This includes providing adequate tissues and maintaining a pleasant environment.
2. **Improve facilities for customers**: Consider enhancing the overall ambiance and comfort of the store, including seating areas and decor, to create a welcoming atmosphere.

**Wait Time**

1. **Optimize staffing during peak hours**: Ensure that there is adequate staffing during peak periods to minimize wait times and maintain service quality.
2. **Streamline service processes**: Analyze and improve service processes to reduce wait times, such as implementing a more efficient ordering system.

**Value for Money**

1. **Maintain consistent quality**: Continue to offer high-quality products and services that meet customer expectations, ensuring that customers feel they receive value for their money.
2. **Review pricing and offerings**: Periodically review pricing and menu offerings to ensure they remain competitive and aligned with customer expectations.

**Digital Experience**

1. **Ensure seamless digital interactions**: Verify that digital interactions, such as ordering and payment processes, are smooth and efficient.
2. **Explore opportunities for digital enhancement**: Consider introducing new digital features or services, such as mobile ordering or digital loyalty programs, to enhance the customer experience.

**Additional Recommendations**

1. **Parking and accessibility**: Consider the limited parking options near the store and explore alternatives, such as partnering with nearby parking providers or promoting alternative modes of transportation.
2. **Staff empowerment**: Empower staff to handle customer issues and complaints in a timely and effective manner, reducing the need for escalation to store managers.
3. **Recognize and reward staff**: Recognize and reward staff for excellent service, reinforcing positive behaviors and motivating staff to maintain high service standards.
