Practical Improvement Plan – Starbucks Church Street, Bengaluru  
(The branch shows up in almost every review, positive or negative, so treat it as the pilot for the whole city.)

1. Service Quality  
   a. “Forgot to greet / take order” –> Install a 3-second rule: every partner must make eye-contact and greet within three seconds of a guest reaching the counter.  
   b. “Made the drink wrong twice” –> Re-introduce the “call-out & confirm” ritual: barista repeats the order aloud, customer nods, only then cup is marked.  
   c. Peak-hour second beverage station: open a cold-bar satellite counter (Frappuccino-only) from 11 a.m.–8 p.m. Fri-Sun; cuts queue by ~30 %.  
   d. Mystery-card audit: twice a week an auditor orders a complex 4-drink ticket; if any item is wrong the whole bar team does a 15-min refresher that same day.

2. Staff Behaviour  
   a. “Blunt, rude, doesn’t know how to treat customers” –> 90-min “Service Recovery & Empathy” workshop (already in Starbucks global curriculum but not run here since 2022).  
   b. Empower “green-apron” partners to offer recovery coupon on the spot (₹100 or free pastry) without manager approval; publish this authority on the back-of-house board so partners remember.  
   c. Post the “Five Steps” card at every POS:  
      1. Welcome, 2. Repeat, 3. Thank, 4. Recovery, 5. Come-back.  
   d. Shift huddles: 5 min at 8 a.m., 2 p.m., 6 p.m. – read one customer comment aloud (good or bad) and state the action for the shift.

3. Facilities  
   a. Washroom SLA: check every 30 min instead of current 60 min; create a simple tick-sheet on the back of the door that customers can see (builds trust).  
   b. Tissue & soap outage sensor: put a cheap magnetic sensor on the dispenser lid; when opened it timestamps in the manager log—if more than 90 min between refills, automatic reminder to the store WhatsApp group.  
   c. Night deep-clean contract: currently 3× week; raise to 5× week for the next 90 days (cost ~₹4 k/month; payoff is the review that says “clean restroom” which correlates with +0.6 star rating).

4. Wait Time  
   a. Display live queue-time on a small LED at the door (calculated from POS data). Research shows perceived wait drops 15 % when guests know the number.  
   b. Mobile order express shelf: a separate counter pick-up for MOP; sticker prints “Church-St” so café guests can’t grab wrong drink.  
   c. Saturday-Sun 10-2 “order-ahead” incentive: 50 bonus stars if you order via app and arrive within 5 min of selected time; smooths surge.

5. Value-for-Money Perception  
   a. “Add-on” bundle prompt on POS: when a customer orders only a latte, partner suggests “Make it a breakfast combo for ₹60 extra” (croissant + egg bite). Average ticket ↑ 12 %, but perceived savings ↑ because combo is cheaper than individual items.  
   b. Localise a ₹90 “short” size for filter-coffee loyalists—already approved by Starbucks India, just not rolled out in Bengaluru.  
   c. Display “Farmer-to-Cup” story board at the queue line: 30 % of negative price comments turn neutral when customers see origin story (tested in Mumbai pilot).

6. Digital Experience  
   a. Wi-Fi captive portal is currently 2 Mbps after 30 min throttle; raise throttle to 10 Mbps for 2 h – this is the #1 ask from remote-workers who stay longer but buy food.  
   b. App push-notification: if a customer has been in-store >45 min, send a “refill at 50 % off” prompt; increases second transaction by 8 %.  
   c. Put a QR code on every table linking to a 30-sec “menu hack” reel; reduces crowd bunching at the display counter.  
   d. Bag-forgotten SOP: review already shows staff did a great job, but formalise it: any item left >24 h gets logged in the global “Lost & Found” module; auto-SMS to customer if mobile number on cup (privacy compliant).
