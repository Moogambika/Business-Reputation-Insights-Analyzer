Apollo Hospitals Chennai – Executive Voice-of-Customer Summary  
(Reviews received Q4-2023 / early-2024)

1. Overall Sentiment  
• 75-80 % of comments are strongly positive; the balance are mixed-to-negative.  
• Patients repeatedly use words “grateful”, “life-saving”, “world-class”, “compassionate”; negative comments centre on “shocked”, “confused”, “stressed”.

2. Satisfaction at a Glance  
• Clinical outcome – 9/10 (perceived medical skill, surgical success, speed of recovery).  
• Human touch – 9/10 (doctors and nurses praised by name for empathy).  
• Service system – 6/10 (delightful when everything clicks; frustrating when it doesn’t).  
• Value for money – 5/10 (frequent sticker-shock and opaque billing).

3. Recurring Themes  

Positive Drivers  
• Hero Doctors: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT), Dr. M. Rehan Sayeed (CTVS), Dr. Kartik Natarajan (GI), Dr. Raghunath K J (Surgery) and several ICU specialists are called out for “masterful skill + calming presence”.  
• Nursing & Allied Staff: described as “attentive, gentle, prompt—remembered our names”.  
• Infrastructure: clean, well-signposted, modern equipment; Platinum Wing likened to a “five-star stay-cation”.  
• Speed in Emergencies: door-to-balloon times for MI, rapid response to Code Blue situations.  
• Seamless Diagnostics: pre-op clearances, labs and pharmacy turn-around times praised.

Pain Points  
• Internal Navigation & Coordination: patients moved “from pillar to post”; no single care-coordinator; long waits between departments.  
• Pricing Transparency: several cases of 2-3× expected cost for day-care / cyst / basic endoscopy; quotes given exclude consumables, room-category uplift, consultant fees.  
• Billing Desk Attitude: “take it or leave it” feel; itemised statements only on insistence.  
• Insurance / TPA friction cited repeatedly.  
• Parking & Valet smooth at front gate, but once inside “you’re on your own”.

4. Verbatim Risk Statements (abridged)  
“We left Greams Lane feeling the hospital is run for profit first, patients second.”  
“Had we known the final figure we would have flown back to Kolkata.”  
“No-one tells you where to go next; we missed an X-ray slot and surgery postponed by a day.”

5. Strategic Take-aways for Management  
• Deploy a “care navigator” (one WhatsApp number / app) for every elective case; mandatory cost-sheet with patient e-signature before admission.  
• Price-band calculator for common day-care procedures; publish 80-percentile package rate on website.  
• Centralised queue-management (already piloted in cardiology) to be rolled out hospital-wide.  
• Create a “price-match” desk for routine surgeries—offer to meet reputable competitor quote; converts detractors into promoters.  
• Continue investing in nursing excellence—this is the hospital’s clearest differentiator.

Bottom line: Apollo Chennai is clinically trusted and emotionally valued; it risks brand erosion unless it fixes billing transparency and intra-hospital coordination.
