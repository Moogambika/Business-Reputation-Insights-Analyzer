Deccan Monk,a week ago,4.0,"Starbucks (Church Street) Spacious outlet with the signature Starbucks calm — good crowd energy. Ideal for long work sessions or relaxed coffee meets. Seating mix of sofas, bar chairs, and outdoor spots. Staff are friendly, remember your regular order if you visit often. Consistent coffee quality, quick Wi-Fi, clean washroom. Peak hours (evenings/weekends) get busy — grab seats early. Nice people-watching spot facing Church Street’s hustle."
Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks
Rohit Belakud,a year ago,4.0,"Starbucks offers consistently great coffee with a wide range of drinks and snacks. The ambiance is cozy, perfect for working or meeting friends. Service is generally fast and friendly, though it can get busy during peak hours. A reliable spot for coffee lovers!"
Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."
Stan Camsis,2 weeks ago,1.0,"I visited the place with my friend. We had and beverage abd food everything was delicious, but the washroom wasn't clean; it smelled ther is no tissues its awful. When I went to ask the employee wearing a blue T shirt, he told me they didn't have any tissues. What a blunt way to put it! He was so rude; he doesn't know how to treat customers."
Samer Shehab,3 months ago,1.0,The staff is slow. They made mistakes twice in preparing the order. The worst branch I have visited in my life.
Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks
Rohit Belakud,a year ago,4.0,"Starbucks offers consistently great coffee with a wide range of drinks and snacks. The ambiance is cozy, perfect for working or meeting friends. Service is generally fast and friendly, though it can get busy during peak hours. A reliable spot for coffee lovers!"
Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."
Stan Camsis,2 weeks ago,1.0,"I visited the place with my friend. We had and beverage abd food everything was delicious, but the washroom wasn't clean; it smelled ther is no tissues its awful. When I went to ask the employee wearing a blue T shirt, he told me they didn't have any tissues. What a blunt way to put it! He was so rude; he doesn't know how to treat customers."
Samer Shehab,3 months ago,1.0,The staff is slow. They made mistakes twice in preparing the order. The worst branch I have visited in my life.
Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."

Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks

Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."

Deccan Monk,a week ago,4.0,"Starbucks (Church Street) Spacious outlet with the signature Starbucks calm — good crowd energy. Ideal for long work sessions or relaxed coffee meets.

Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks

Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."
Stan Camsis,2 weeks ago,1.0,"I visited the place with my friend. We had and beverage abd food everything was delicious, but the washroom wasn't clean; it smelled ther is no tissues its awful. When I went to ask the employee wearing a blue T shirt, he told me they didn't have any tissues. What a blunt way to put it! He was so rude; he doesn't know how to treat customers."

Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks

Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."

Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks
Rohit Belakud,a year ago,4.0,"Starbucks offers consistently great coffee with a wide range of drinks and snacks. The ambiance is cozy, perfect for working or meeting friends. Service is generally fast and friendly, though it can get busy during peak hours. A reliable spot for coffee lovers!"
Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."
Stan Camsis,2 weeks ago,1.0,"I visited the place with my friend. We had and beverage abd food everything was delicious, but the washroom wasn't clean; it smelled ther is no tissues its awful. When I went to ask the employee wearing a blue T shirt, he told me they didn't have any tissues. What a blunt way to put it! He was so rude; he doesn't know how to treat customers."

Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

Rohit Belakud,a year ago,4.0,"Starbucks offers consistently great coffee with a wide range of drinks and snacks. The ambiance is cozy, perfect for working or meeting friends. Service is generally fast and friendly, though it can get busy during peak hours. A reliable spot for coffee lovers!"
Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."

Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."

Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks

Sivanesan Sadasivam,11 months ago,4.0,"Starbucks on Church Street, Bengaluru, is an exceptional spot that effortlessly combines the charm of a vibrant café with the serene ambiance of a perfect retreat. Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks

Located in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic streets, this outlet exudes warmth and sophistication, making it a favorite destination for coffee lovers and social gatherings alike. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee, instantly uplifting your spirits. The décor is a blend of contemporary elegance and cozy vibes, with two floors of comfortable seating that caters to couples, solo visitors, friends catching up, or even those working remotely. The subtle lighting and soothing music add a touch of tranquility, making it an ideal escape from the bustling city outside. The menu, as always, features Starbucks’ signature range of coffees, teas, and seasonal specials. Their handcrafted beverages are consistently delightful, with my personal favorite being the Java chip frupichino, paired perfectly with a warm croissant. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures a seamless experience, even during busy hours. One of the standout aspects of this outlet is its first floor seating area, it offers a refreshing space to enjoy your coffee while soaking in the vibrant energy of Church Street. Overall, Starbucks Church Street is not just a café but a destination in itself. Whether you're here for a quick caffeine fix, a relaxed evening, or to catch up on work, this Starbucks delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!"

Deccan Monk,a week ago,4.0,"Starbucks (Church Street) Spacious outlet with the signature Starbucks calm — good crowd energy. Ideal for long work sessions or relaxed coffee meets. Seating mix of sofas, bar chairs, and outdoor spots. Staff are friendly, remember your regular order if you visit often. Consistent coffee quality, quick Wi-Fi, clean washroom. Peak hours (evenings/weekends) get busy — grab seats early. Nice people-watching spot facing Church Street’s hustle."
Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks
Rohit Belakud,a year ago,4.0,"Starbucks offers consistently great coffee with a wide range of drinks and snacks. The ambiance is cozy, perfect for working or meeting friends. Service is generally fast and friendly, though it can get busy during peak hours. A reliable spot for coffee lovers!"
Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."
Stan Camsis,2 weeks ago,1.0,"I visited the place with my friend. We had and beverage abd food everything was delicious, but the washroom wasn't clean; it smelled ther is no tissues its awful. When I went to ask the employee wearing a blue T shirt, he told me they didn't have any tissues. What a blunt way to put it! He was so rude; he doesn't know how to treat customers."

SHAMAL AV,a year ago,5.0,Excellent place for meetings. Situated at the start of church street and Brigade road. Sitting space at ground and first floor. Availed the 25% off for the first 3 orders.No parking options. You can use the normal church street parking and walk. Metro is also nearby.
Deccan Monk,a week ago,4.0,"Starbucks (Church Street) Spacious outlet with the signature Starbucks calm — good crowd energy. Ideal for long work sessions or relaxed coffee meets. Seating mix of sofas, bar chairs, and outdoor spots. Staff are friendly, remember your regular order if you visit often. Consistent coffee quality, quick Wi-Fi, clean washroom. Peak hours (evenings/weekends) get busy — grab seats early. Nice people-watching spot facing Church Street’s hustle."
Akshay Nalakonda,5 months ago,5.0,The best Starbucks I have ever gone to. I kept ma bag of apparel there and forgot it. I live in Whitefields. so I asked one of Nike’s employee to get there and collect my bag and the Starbucks employee wanted to see me in FaceTime and only when I agreed to giving the bag to the Nike employee. He gave it. This shows how experienced he is and also doesn’t want my bag to go into bad hands. I am so grateful to him. I have posted a picture of him aswell. Thanks Starbucks

Dr. Adhishesh Kaul,3 weeks ago,1.0,"Visited this store today at around 8:15am, confirmed with the staff if the outlet is open or closed, after confirming that the store is operational at the given time, waited for about 10 min and the barista forget taking order did not even greet or ask to wait. She continued to do her work as if the customer standing in front did not exist at all. Such a lackadaisical attitude is not expected at Starbucks especially when the customer is a very regular customer at various other outlets and knows the quality of service provided. Informed the store manager over call about the same."
Stan Camsis,2 weeks ago,1.0,"I visited the place with my friend. We had and beverage abd food everything was delicious, but the washroom wasn't clean; it smelled ther is no tissues its awful. When I went to ask the employee wearing a blue T shirt, he told me they didn't have any tissues. What a blunt way to put it! He was so rude; he doesn't know how to treat customers."
Samer Shehab,3 months ago,1.0,The staff is slow. They made mistakes twice in preparing the order. The worst branch I have visited in my life.
