ashish Singh,a month ago,5.0,"I visited Taj Mumbai today and had lunch at their Shamiana Restaurant with my wife, my sister, and my sister’s 6-month-old son. The experience was absolutely delightful. Right from the entrance, the ambiance felt luxurious and welcoming. The décor is elegant, and the seating arrangement is very comfortable, making it perfect for a relaxed family lunch. The food we ordered was excellent. Every dish reflected authentic flavors and high-quality ingredients. The taste, freshness, and presentation were all top-notch. The food was expensive, of course, but completely worth it for the quality and the overall experience. You can feel the attention to detail in both cooking and plating, which adds to the premium dining experience. What really stood out was the staff. They were exceptionally polite, attentive, and professional – truly the best of the best. They even went out of their way to help with my 6-month-old nephew, so my sister could enjoy her lunch in peace. Their care and warm nature made the meal even more enjoyable and stress-free, especially when dining with a baby. Overall, Shamiana Restaurant at Taj Mumbai is perfect for anyone looking for authentic, high-quality food in a luxurious setting with impeccable service. The combination of delicious cuisine, elegant ambiance, thoughtful staff, and premium quality makes it an unforgettable dining experience. Highly recommended for families, couples, and anyone wanting a premium dining experience in Mumbai."

za Shaikh,a month ago,5.0,"Had the privilege of visiting The Taj Mahal Palace for an interview with Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, regarding the UK-India Free Trade Agreement. As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan. The Taj Mahal Palace will always remain a symbol of excellence, heritage, and heart."

You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan. The Taj Mahal Palace will always remain a symbol of excellence, heritage, and heart."

ashish Singh,a month ago,5.0,"I visited Taj Mumbai today and had lunch at their Shamiana Restaurant with my wife, my sister, and my sister’s 6-month-old son. The experience was absolutely delightful.

The food we ordered was excellent. Every dish reflected authentic flavors and high-quality ingredients. The taste, freshness, and presentation were all top-notch. The food was expensive, of course, but completely worth it for the quality and the overall experience. You can feel the attention to detail in both cooking and plating, which adds to the premium dining experience. What really stood out was the staff. They were exceptionally polite, attentive, and professional – truly the best of the best. They even went out of their way to help with my 6-month-old nephew, so my sister could enjoy her lunch in peace. Their care and warm nature made the meal even more enjoyable and stress-free, especially when dining with a baby. Overall, Shamiana Restaurant at Taj Mumbai is perfect for anyone looking for authentic, high-quality food in a luxurious setting with impeccable service.

za Shaikh,a month ago,5.0,"Had the privilege of visiting The Taj Mahal Palace for an interview with Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, regarding the UK-India Free Trade Agreement. As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan. The Taj Mahal Palace will always remain a symbol of excellence, heritage, and heart."

As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan.

za Shaikh,a month ago,5.0,"Had the privilege of visiting The Taj Mahal Palace for an interview with Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, regarding the UK-India Free Trade Agreement. As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan. The Taj Mahal Palace will always remain a symbol of excellence, heritage, and heart."

As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan.

za Shaikh,a month ago,5.0,"Had the privilege of visiting The Taj Mahal Palace for an interview with Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, regarding the UK-India Free Trade Agreement. As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan. The Taj Mahal Palace will always remain a symbol of excellence, heritage, and heart."

As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan.

za Shaikh,a month ago,5.0,"Had the privilege of visiting The Taj Mahal Palace for an interview with Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, regarding the UK-India Free Trade Agreement. As always, stepping into the Taj is nothing short of a royal experience — where every corner radiates warmth, grace, and an unmatched sense of hospitality. You don’t just stay here; you’re loved, pampered, and made to feel truly special. Every visit offers a new memory, a new feeling, and a renewed sense of awe. Today’s visit was especially emotional — it happened to be the death anniversary of the legendary Shri Ratan Tata sir. While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan. The Taj Mahal Palace will always remain a symbol of excellence, heritage, and heart."

While I was thrilled about the interview, there was also a deep sense of sadness remembering the loss of an invaluable gem the world lost last year on this very day. Forever a Tata fan. The Taj Mahal Palace will always remain a symbol of excellence, heritage, and heart."

Right from the entrance, the ambiance felt luxurious and welcoming. The décor is elegant, and the seating arrangement is very comfortable, making it perfect for a relaxed family lunch. The food we ordered was excellent. Every dish reflected authentic flavors and high-quality ingredients. The taste, freshness, and presentation were all top-notch. The food was expensive, of course, but completely worth it for the quality and the overall experience. You can feel the attention to detail in both cooking and plating, which adds to the premium dining experience. What really stood out was the staff. They were exceptionally polite, attentive, and professional – truly the best of the best. They even went out of their way to help with my 6-month-old nephew, so my sister could enjoy her lunch in peace. Their care and warm nature made the meal even more enjoyable and stress-free, especially when dining with a baby. Overall, Shamiana Restaurant at Taj Mumbai is perfect for anyone looking for authentic, high-quality food in a luxurious setting with impeccable service.
