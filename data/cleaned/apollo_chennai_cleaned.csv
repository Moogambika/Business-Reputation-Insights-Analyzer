Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.
Ameeta Jaypal,Edited a month ago,5.0,"Room no 3326 Housekeeping service was very good,specially Gopal went out of his way to help. We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."
GUNAMONI KALITA,4 months ago,5.0,"Heartfelt Review & Recommendation for Dr. Kartik Natarajan, Gastroenterologist at Apollo One. I wish to express my sincere gratitude and admiration for Dr. Kartik Natarajan, Gastroenterologist at Apollo One, Greams Road. He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence. What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"

The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"

Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence.

He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"

The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"

Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence.

He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"

The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"

Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence.

He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"

The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"

Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence.

He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"

The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"

Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence.

He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"

The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"

Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence.

He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"

The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"

Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour. May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."

He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence.

He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."

The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

We had a warmth welcome n everyone was very nice I would like to thank Dr Mohammad Rehan n his entire team for their professionalism n all the ICU staff n the private ward staffI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Mohamad Rehan Sayeed for successfully performing my CABG surgery and for the outstanding care I received throughout this journey. His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference. I also wish to recall that when I landed in Chennai on 02.09.25, I came across a billboard that read: “Chennai is the City of Health.” This statement truly reflects what many around the world believe — that in healthcare, Chennai stands as a world leader. With doctors like Dr. Sayeed and his highly competent team, the city has every reason to be proud of this honour.

Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth.

May God bless doctors like Dr. Sayeed so that, one day, people everywhere may be free from the suffering caused by ill health."
GUNAMONI KALITA,4 months ago,5.0,"Heartfelt Review & Recommendation for Dr. Kartik Natarajan, Gastroenterologist at Apollo One. I wish to express my sincere gratitude and admiration for Dr. Kartik Natarajan, Gastroenterologist at Apollo One, Greams Road. He is truly a star doctor of the Apollo Hospitals' Gastroenterology Department. Dr. Kartik's vast experience, accurate diagnosis, and outstanding treatment approach reflect the true essence of Apollo Hospitals’ excellence. What sets him apart is not only his medical expertise but also his kindness, patience, and friendly behavior. He listens with genuine concern, makes patients feel at ease, and explains everything with remarkable clarity and compassion. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Kartik Natarajan to anyone in need of expert gastroenterological care. His dedication and humane approach truly uphold the values and reputation of Apollo Hospitals. Thank you, Doctor, for being a source of hope and healing."
Lady Khadija,a week ago,5.0,"I recently had my gallbladder removed at Apollo Hospital, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the excellent care I received. For over a year, I suffered from severe gallbladder attacks and kept trying to manage the pain, but it kept getting worse. I was very nervous about surgery since it was my first one, but I finally made the decision to go ahead, and it’s truly changed my life for the better. Choosing a doctor can be overwhelming with so many options, but I was referred to Dr. Raghunath K. J., who came highly recommended. He performed my cholecystectomy surgery with great skill and care. Although there were some complications that made the procedure longer than usual, Dr. Raghunath handled everything calmly and professionally, detecting and resolving the underlying issues. I stayed in the hospital for two nights and was extremely well taken care of by the whole team — Dr. Raghunath K. J., Dr. Ashwin, Dr. Jane, Farhath, Meena, and Kavita. Their attention, compassion, and professionalism made the whole experience so much easier. Now that I’m back home in Tanzania, eating well and feeling healthy. Thank you to Apollo Hospital and to the amazing team for helping me get through this with such great results. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done! — Khadija (Tanzanian Patient)"
Debargha Chattaraj,3 weeks ago,5.0,"We are truly grateful to Apollo Chennai, and especially everyone in the L Ward Extension, where my father was admitted for 13 days due to his complicated condition, for their amazing care and support during my father's treatment. The hospital was very well-managed, even small issues, whenever reported, were taken care of immediately and efficiently. The environment was clean, organized, and the staff always made sure patients and families were comfortable. Every nurse, staff member, and caretaker there was extremely helpful, calm, and kind. Our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Babu Manohar Sir and Dr. M. Saravanan Sir, whose expertise and compassion made this difficult journey much easier for our family. The coordination between the doctors, nurses, and support staff was truly impressive, and we always felt that my father was in the safest hands. We will always remember the kindness and care shown to our family during this time."
Parikshit Basu,2 weeks ago,2.0,"I recently had the experience of visiting Greams Lane Apollo Hospital in Chennai, and while there are some positive aspects, I was ultimately disappointed with the overall service provided. Positive Aspects: The hospital is well-maintained and clean, which creates a reassuring environment for patients. Additionally, the valet parking service was a thoughtful touch, offering convenience for visitors. Areas for Improvement: However, my experience with the internal coordination was less than satisfactory. While the coordination outside the hospital (such as valet parking) was efficient, the process within the hospital was poorly managed. Patients or their families are required to independently navigate between departments for various tasks, without clear guidance or support. This lack of internal coordination created unnecessary confusion and delays, making the overall experience stressful. Cost Transparency & Pricing: One of the most concerning aspects of my visit was the pricing structure. My daughter underwent a relatively simple procedure to remove a cyst in the Day Care facility, which ended up costing over Rs. 1,00,000. This price was never disclosed to me beforehand, despite my repeated attempts to clarify the costs. The final amount was a shock, and I found it to be exorbitant considering the nature of the procedure. This procedure could have been performed at other reputable hospital for maximum 25% - 35% of this cost. Comparison to Other Locations: I have previously visited the Kolkata Apollo Hospital, which, in my experience, offers a much better level of internal coordination, transparency in pricing, and overall cost-effectiveness. I am confused about the rationale as lots of Bengali people come to Apollo Chennai for treatment. Conclusion: While Greams Lane Apollo may be well-maintained, the lack of coordination between departments, coupled with the shockingly high and opaque pricing, has left me with serious reservations about recommending this hospital for routine procedures. I would advise potential patients to inquire thoroughly about costs and seek clarification about internal processes before committing to treatment."
Kaushik Saha,4 weeks ago,5.0,"The Epitome of Healing and Hospitality: A Review of Apollo Main Hospitals & Platinum Wing ​Patient: Kamal Kumar Saha | Procedure: Successful Septoplasty Review by: Kaushik Saha, Son Date: October 23, 2025 ​Our journey at Apollo Main Hospitals, Chennai, was nothing short of transformational—a blend of medical excellence and a world-class 'staycation' that redefined our perception of healthcare. The successful septoplasty performed on my father, Mr. Kamal Kumar Saha, was the centerpiece of an experience orchestrated with brilliance and compassion at every turn. ​The Maestro: Dr. R. Balaji (ENT Surgeon) ​The surgical outcome is a testament to the masterful skill of Dr. R. Balaji. From the initial consultation, Dr. Balaji’s calm assurance and crystal-clear explanation of the septoplasty procedure eliminated all anxiety. His extensive experience in Otorhinolaryngology was evident in the flawless execution of the surgery. Post-operatively, my father's breathing improved dramatically and immediately. Dr. Balaji is not just a surgeon; he is a specialist whose proficiency elevates the entire institution. ​A City of Care: The Apollo Main Hospitals Ecosystem ​The hospital itself is a meticulously managed ecosystem, operating with the precision of a high-tech city. Every department contributed to our seamless experience: ​Clinical Excellence (The Frontline): The Pre-Anesthesia team prepared my father with diligence, and the post-operative monitoring by the Critical Care unit was vigilant and reassuring. The Emergency Medicine department, though thankfully not needed, provided comfort simply by knowing it operated 24/7 with readiness. ​Diagnostic & Support Services (The Backbone): The efficiency of the Radiology and Pathology/Diagnostics labs ensured swift and accurate pre-op clearances. The Pharmacy team managed our complex medication schedule promptly, and the Physiotherapy & Rehabilitation experts provided useful post-surgical advice for general mobility and recovery. ​Specialty Centers (The Assurance): It is deeply reassuring to be in a hospital where the Centres of Excellence, such as the Apollo Heart Institute, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, and Oncology, stand ready. This breadth of capability offers an unparalleled layer of security. ​Management & Administration (The Engine): The Front Office and Billing/Insurance departments handled complex paperwork with speed and grace, allowing us to focus entirely on recovery. Their professionalism is the smooth oil that keeps this massive operation running. ​The Sanctuary: Platinum Wing (Apollo Sindoori Hotel Limited) ​Our stay in the Platinum Wing, managed by Apollo Sindoori, was truly a luxury staycation integrated with healing. This was not a hospital room; it was a sanctuary. ​The Housekeeping and Facility Management staff were discreet and impeccable, maintaining pristine conditions. The true highlight was the personalized hospitality and Catering Services. The food, tailored to my father's post-operative diet and our own preferences, was gourmet-level, freshly prepared, and served with warmth. The Sindoori team transformed a medical requirement into a genuinely restorative experience, ensuring comfort, peace, and five-star service throughout our recovery period. ​In conclusion, our profound gratitude extends from the skill of Dr. Balaji to the warmth of the nursing staff, the rigor of the clinical teams, and the comforting luxury of the Platinum Wing. Apollo Main Hospitals, supported by Apollo Sindoori, is truly setting a global standard where patient care and sophisticated hospitality converge. We wholeheartedly recommend this institution. ​Kaushik Saha Son of Kamal Kumar Saha"
Russell Jashim Uddin,2 weeks ago,4.0,We stayed Apollo Chennai at room 3305. House keeping service was adequately good. Particularly Ms. Asma and Mr. Kishore were outstanding with their prompt responses and good care.
Ravi Ivaturi,2 months ago,5.0,The paramedics were great and immediately knew that I had a heart attack and informed the main hospital asap. The ICU cardiac unit team of doctors and support staff were ready and administered what was needed to save me..in the end I had a laser angioplasty which cleared the 100% clot and I got a new lease of life. I owe my life to that team and their service with a smile is still etched deep in my memory. Kudos to them and I salute them.

His expertise, confidence, and compassionate approach gave me and my family immense reassurance during a very critical time. My sincere thanks also go to the entire team — the emergency staff for their swift action, the nursing team for their tireless care, and the cleaning staff for maintaining a safe and hygienic environment. Each of them played an essential role in my recovery. A special mention goes to Dr. Kavya, whose clear explanations and constant guidance made the medical process easier to understand and less stressful. I am also grateful to Nalini, Dr. Sayeed’s assistant, whose coordination and kindness helped everything run smoothly. In the ICU, Nurse Afiya’s attentiveness, patience, and genuine care during the most critical hours of my recovery made a lasting difference.
